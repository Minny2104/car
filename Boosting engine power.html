    <h1>BOOSTING ENGINE POWER </h1>
    <div>
<p><strong> We offer professional modifications and engine power boosting, always preceded by the careful measurement
    <br>of the current power using the SuperFlow AutoDyn AWD30 cylindrical brake. Based on the evaluation of graphs, 
    <br>we perform precise and unique tuning, specifically tailored for your car.
</strong></p>
<p>
    The actual modification and increase of the engine power is performed according to the clientâ€™s request.
     In Stage 1,<br> we apply the data and parameters modification of the ECM control unit through the interfaces: EcuTek, Cobb, Sywecs,<br> MoTeC.
In Stages 2, 3, and Individual, it is necessary to install the necessary HighPerformance components prior<br>to the tuning to ensure the required performance.

<h3>ECUTEK FIRST</h3>

<p><strong>Since we are the exclusive Nissan GT-R vehicle EcuTek representative (tuner) for the Czech Republic and Slovakia,<br> we prefer to tune and increase engine power using the software of the mentioned UK-based company.</strong></p>
<p>The system is absolutely simple and unique to allow the modification of parameters directly in the engine control unit.<br>Therefore, there is no need for any other interference through wiring or other systems on the vehicle.</p>
<p>When buying a BT Module, the ECUconnect application allows you to instantly connect the vehicle online via Smart Phone.<br> This gives us maximum overview over the vehicle, the ability to adjust and customize many parameters, onboard diagnostics<br>with logging capability and many other additional features.</p>
