    <h1>GEARBOX STRENGTHENING AND TRACKING MODIFICATION</h1>

<p><strong>The Nissan GT-R features a Borg-Warner 6-speed Dual-clutch gearbox GR6. The gearbox is conceptually located on the rear axle,<br> with the engine drive connected by the cardan shaft.The front axle torque is transmitted by the integrated ETS electromagnetic clutch,<br>which is controlled by the FWD control unit. Torque transmission on the front axle is again provided by the cardan shaft.</strong>
<br>Thanks to two-clutch technology, the gear shifting of the individual gears is very accurate and fast (180ms) and the carâ€™s driving is very dynamic.<br>With slow manoeuvring or shifting while not driving, some strange sounds can sometimes be heard from the gearbox, but this is not unusual<br>according to the manufacturer.<br>
In any case, the gearbox requires regular maintenance every 15K km when the clutch gear learning is implemented.</p>
<p>After 30K km, the complete oil cartridge (10L) must be replaced, including two integrated oil filters. The maintenance also includes<br>the oil change in the front and rear differential.<br>
<br>The R35 engine has a great power at the default configuration, which has to be perfectly taken on by the gearbox. The first<br>model years of GT-R (2008-2010) were particularly faulty mainly due to gearbox and traction failures. This is why<br>modifications and improvements were introduced, to prevent unwanted damage.<br>
Of course, we offer countless modifications and upgrades of the complete transmission system, especially in terms of the engine power/torque.<br><br>
