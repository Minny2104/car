    <h1>PROFESSIONAL MAINTENANCE OF AUTOMATIC GEARBOXES</h1>
<p><strong>The vast majority of car makers claim that the oil fillings in automatic gearboxes last lifetime. This is not really a lie,<br>even though it does not reflect the actual service life of the gearbox or the entire car. This magical number can differ<br>considerably - whether it is 500K or just 100K km driven. So the word “lifelong” sounds great, but it does really tell you anything specific.</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the type and number of gears, automatic gearboxes are extremely sensitive aggregates. Thus, the cleanliness<br>of the oil filling is paramount. It is not true what many people say that there are carbonaceous sediments forming in the gearboxes. <br>The oil gradually deteriorates by the mechanical wear of the inner parts and also ages naturally.<br>
    In practice, therefore, the first ATF can be used for a maximum of 80-100K km, and then it must be carefully replaced with new oil, <br>including a flush. If the oil filter (sieve) is accessible without removing and disassembling the gearbox, replace it too.</p>
<p>Every subsequent oil change must be performed within 40-60K km driven. This will ensure that the gearbox runs with high-quality oil filling.<br>The most common faults of the AT gearbox are due to contaminated oils, which cannot sufficiently fulfil their function.</p>

<h2><strong>WE OFFER OIL EXCHANGE USING THE BEST AVAILABLE METHOD - A PROFESSIONAL ATF FILLER.</strong></h2>
<p>The principle is very simple. Connect the discharge and filling hoses of the ATF filler to the gearbox hydraulic circuit. Thanks to the built-in pump,<br>we achieve almost complete suction of the old oil from the gearbox, the hydrodynamic converter and the gearbox cooler. Remove the oil filter and <br>the oil pan gasket, if applicable, as soon as the gearbox is empty. Subsequently, the process of filling the new oil starts, including <br>the automate level detection. The whole operation takes between 2 and 4 hours, depending on the type of the vehicle and the oil contamination. <br>The type of the oil filling is chosen strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
